                            Rugby union, widely known simply as rugby, is a full contact team sport that originated in 
                            England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is 
                            based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between 
                            two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The 
                            field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.

                            ages. Rules do not differ between the sexes. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people 
                            playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. World Rugby, previously
